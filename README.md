# Retail Support Escalation Triage

## Project Overview

Retail Support Escalation Triage is a complete full-stack AI project for **Simple RAG** at **Beginner** difficulty. It includes a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, sample documents, vector search with ChromaDB support, source citations, timeline logs, structured run storage, Docker files, and tests.

Retail support escalation triage involves categorizing customer support requests based on their urgency and complexity.

Difficulty controls project complexity, architecture depth, AI model selection, and how advanced the generated codebase is.

- Architecture depth: minimal backend, simple folder structure, easy README, low-cost/free model
- Selected architecture: Customer Support KB Search
- Template path: templates/simple-rag/customer-support-kb-search
- Generated stack: FastAPI backend, React UI, local vector fallback, simple tests
- README style: beginner-friendly setup and clear expected output

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- AI/RAG: LangChain-ready prompt layer, ChromaDB vector storage, local deterministic fallback model
- Workflow: Agent pipeline with planner, retrieval, tool, reasoning, and final answer steps
- Frontend: React and Vite
- Database: SQLite by default, PostgreSQL through Docker Compose
- Testing: pytest
- Difficulty: Beginner

## Generation Method

This project was generated with a template-based architecture engine. AI is used only for the blueprint, domain customization, sample data, prompts, and documentation. The codebase is produced from tested FastAPI/React/Docker templates rather than raw LLM source output.

## Why This Project Satisfies Simple RAG

This repository satisfies **Simple RAG** because it includes runnable implementation evidence, domain-specific workflow steps, validation gates, and portfolio documentation instead of only describing the idea.

## Project Type Satisfaction Map

This generated project satisfies **Simple RAG** through the runtime path below. The implementation is not only a README claim: the files listed after the diagram are generated in the repository and validated before GitHub push.

Runtime proof points:

- `frontend/src/App.jsx` renders the user workspace, starter prompts, answer panel, cited sources, and timeline.
- `backend/app/main.py` exposes `POST /api/ask` and returns the final answer, sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- `backend/app/services/pipeline.py` orchestrates the project-type flow: Retriever, Citation Answer Builder.
- `backend/app/services/vector_store.py` loads sample documents and retrieves relevant cited context.
- `backend/app/domain.py` contains the generated topic-specific workflow steps, business rules, tools, persona, and starter questions.
- `backend/app/db.py` stores each run so the generated app behaves like a real workflow tool instead of a static prompt demo.
- `backend/tests/test_project_contract.py` validates the API contract and project-type behavior.

Type-specific behavior:

- Flow style: User question -> load documents -> split chunks -> embed -> Chroma similarity search -> answer with citations.
- Visible output: final answer, cited sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- Validation gate: pytest, frontend build, Docker Compose config, and Docker build before repository upload.

## Environment Variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
USE_CREWAI_RUNTIME=false
PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

The app runs without an OpenAI key by using a deterministic local answer model. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use LangChain with OpenAI. For CrewAI projects, set `USE_CREWAI_RUNTIME=true` after installing dependencies to run the live CrewAI Agent/Task/Crew workflow; otherwise the app uses a deterministic CrewAI-shaped fallback.

For Pinecone projects, add `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` to use a live Pinecone index. Without them, the repo still runs using local ChromaDB/local retrieval fallback.

## Installation

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Run With Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Example API Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"question\": \"What is the refund policy?\"}"
```

## Example User Question

```text
What should I do if a customer asks for a refund without an order id?
```

## Expected Output

The API returns:

- `answer`: a grounded answer generated from retrieved context
- `sources`: cited document chunks with similarity scores
- `steps`: planner, retriever, reasoning, tool-call, and final-answer timeline logs
- `project_type`: `Simple RAG`

## How The RAG/Agent Flow Works

User question -> load documents -> split chunks -> embed -> Chroma similarity search -> answer with citations.

## Project Planner Agent Workflow

User -> React Dashboard -> FastAPI -> Project Planner Agent -> Specialist Agents -> Generated Project -> Auto Testing -> GitHub Repository Creation -> Push Code -> Return GitHub URL

- **Architecture Agent**: Define app boundaries, data flow, runtime stack, and integration points. Outputs: The architecture is designed to be scalable, modular, and maintainable. Each service has its own database and communicates with other services through APIs..
- **Backend Agent**: Design FastAPI modules, service contracts, validation, and error handling. Outputs: Request Categorization Service: Uses machine learning algorithms to categorize customer support requests; Knowledge Base Service: Provides access to a knowledge base of retail-related information; Analytics Service: Generates analytics and insights on customer support requests.
- **Frontend Agent**: Design React screens, state flow, controls, and user feedback states. Outputs: Request Categorization Interface: Allows agents to categorize customer support requests; Knowledge Base Interface: Provides access to the knowledge base for agents; Analytics Interface: Displays analytics and insights to agents.
- **Database Agent**: Design persistence models, sample data, indexes, and audit records. Outputs: Run history; Source document metadata; Generated workflow audit records.
- **Testing Agent**: Define contract tests, smoke tests, and generated project validation. Outputs: Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing using a testing framework such as Pytest.
- **DevOps Agent**: Define environment variables, Docker workflow, and repository packaging. Outputs: Docker-ready project; Environment sample file; GitHub repository upload.
- **Reviewer Agent**: Review the generated plan for completeness, security, and portfolio quality. Outputs: Request Receipt: Agents receive customer support requests; Request Categorization: Agents categorize customer support requests using the Request Categorization Service; Knowledge Base Access: Agents access the knowledge base using the Knowledge Base Service; Analytics Generation: The Analytics Service generates analytics and insights on customer support requests.

## AI-Customized Domain Workflow

- Request Receipt: Agents receive customer support requests
- Request Categorization: Agents categorize customer support requests using the Request Categorization Service
- Knowledge Base Access: Agents access the knowledge base using the Knowledge Base Service
- Analytics Generation: The Analytics Service generates analytics and insights on customer support requests

## Business Rules

- Categorization Rule: Requests are categorized based on their urgency and complexity
- Knowledge Base Rule: Agents must access the knowledge base before responding to customer support requests
- Analytics Rule: Analytics and insights are generated on a daily basis

1. The backend loads sample documents from `backend/app/data/sample_docs`.
2. Documents are split into chunks.
3. Chunks are embedded and stored in ChromaDB when available, with a local fallback for development.
4. User questions are matched against relevant chunks.
5. Agent-specific steps run: planner, retriever, tool call, reasoning, reviewer, or graph nodes.
6. The final answer is returned with source citations and a timeline.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

## Validation Gates Before GitHub Push
